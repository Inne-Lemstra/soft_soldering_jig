When you first learn soldering a common sentence to hear is "Soldering is simple you just need 3 hands (or more)".
This is also why there are so many soldering accessories like third hands (clamps), vices, putty etc.
This repo is an attempt to create a Jig suitable for general circuit sculpture soldering.

See the 3D_code directory for a description of the files, modules and variable.
